# ACM Transactions 2025

This submodule contains the code required specifically for the ACM Transactions 2025 research and does not generalize to other research and hence can not be stored within the benchmark itself.

The following lines of work are stored here:

1. Showing that connected-speech outperforms vowel enunciation
2. Showing that multi-task learning helps improve classification accuracy
3. Showing that our specific hierarchy helps improve classification accuracy
